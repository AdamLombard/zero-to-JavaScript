# Zero-to-JavaScript
While working to level up my JS skills I keep running across great, entirely free, learn-at-your-own-pace resources that are either:
- A) a little too advanced for where I am currently, or 
- B) something I wish I'd discovered months ago.

So I'm collecting my favorites here, and laying them out in a rough order. There's a lot of content overlap between resources, but that's the way I learn best--in deeper and deeper iterative loops.

The ultimate goal would be to point a total JS neophyte at this doc and say, "Just start at the top."

Suggestions welcome! :)
